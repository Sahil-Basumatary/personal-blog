    content: "a twelve year old kid, who never had any idea whatsover about what even a computer was, took his mothers mobile to play mobile games and watch Mr. Bean on repeat. Ha Ha, honestly, Mr bean was the GOAT. One day, I came accross a random nerf gun video that was where it all started. A passion, passion for creating things. I was mostly a outdoorsy person, I still am. Always used to be in the tennis courts so competitive from the womb. "

    "It was chilly. A very cold, quiet breeze gushed pass my ear and flew away my walmart hat. I had never been to the UK before, so it was uhm.... interesting. I had not set up apple pay and did not know how to navigate through the exit of the airport. Thats where I got scammed.

Always use the tube or the bus which can literally take you anywhere for 2.90 pounds. for zone 1 atleast. More coming soon.."
